Continues reboot with sd card inserted marlin firmware nano35
I am using a Wanhao D12/230 
I have new firmware on 
Everything is working perfectly.
I load the software to sd card printer boots up 
Then asked to select the different corners 
Calibration done and then with the sd card still 
In it reboots every 5 to 10 seconds and won't 
Stop until I take out the sd card
With the printer on and running in insert the 
Sd card and nothing doesn't see it as all 
I have formated and I used 3 different cards 
Still nothing.
I then deactivated sdsupport 
Then I get an error the because I uses tft35 
Display it won't work.
The then changed to an generic tft same problem 
Then I deactivated graphic mode for tft then it 
Works but I can't find the sd card again on the 
Settings on the printer.
